<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earliest life: annual basis, purchaser pays premium to insurer, insurer pays a predetermined sum insured if the insured died during the year. Income and outgo is matched in an annual basis (aka <strong>assessmentism</strong>).</li>
<li>Later 18th century: level premium contract. More complex to model, need to consider both mortality and time value of money.</li>
<li>19th century: the concept of <strong>insurable interest</strong> -- the insurance payout should not leave the beneficiary financially better off than if the insured life had not died.</li>
<li>John Graunt summarized mortality rate using London mortality data from the early 17th century. Edmund Halley further developed a life table that specify mortality rate at each age. He also combined mortality with interest rates to find the value of whole life annuity at different ages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="traditional-life-insurance-contracts">Traditional Life Insurance Contracts</h2>
<h3 id="term-insurance">Term insurance</h3>
<p>Pays a lump sum benefit on the death of the insured, provided the death occurs before the end of a specific term (ranged typically from 10 to 30 years).</p>
<p>Plan doesn't have cash value so lapsing will not have money for policyholder.</p>
<p>Variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company may buy term insurance for their key employers (aka key person insurance or company owned life insurance, COLI)</li>
<li>Some term insurance has decreasing sum insured (typically used in conjunction with a home loan)</li>
<li>Renewable term insurance allow policyholder to renew their policy with a higher  premiums (but insurability is guaranteed).</li>
<li>Convertible term insurance offers the option to convert to a whole life insurance (and insurability is guaranteed).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whole-life-insurance">Whole life insurance</h3>
<p>Pays a lump sum benefit on the death of the policyholder whenever it occurs.</p>
<p>Discontinue the policy would be eligible for a <strong>cash value</strong> or <strong>surrender value</strong>, representing the investment part of the accumulated premiums.</p>
<p>Investment income is much more significant to fund the death benefits, when comparing to term life. But since predicting long term investment is difficult, the investment assumption is very conservative.</p>
<p>Some insurance will distribute investment profit (such plan usually has higher premiums). It is called <strong>participating insurance</strong>, or par insurance, or with-profit. The policyholders' share of profits is called dividends (in NA) or bonuses, and it can come in different methods (policyholders can choose too):</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash refunds. Common for NA par insurance. Easy to understand but may be taxable. It also requires insurers to liquidate assets so can be expensive to operate.</li>
<li>Premium reduction.</li>
<li>Increase death benefits. More complex to understand but more tax efficient. But policyholder may lose their profits should they surrender the plan. No need to liquidate assets and thus provides more potential for future profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>In UK, profits are distributed in the form of benefit increase. Reversionary bonuses are applied to contracts in force, while terminal bonuses are used to top up the sum insured when benefit is paid. There are 3 variations of reversionary bonuses:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple reversionary bonus: bonus rate is applied to the sum insured only,</li>
<li>compound reversionary bonus: bonus rate is applied to the sum insured and the previous bonuses, and</li>
<li>super-compound reversionary bonus: one bonus rate is applied to the sum insured, another bonus rate is applied to the total of previous bonus.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="endowment-insurance">Endowment insurance</h3>
<p>Pays a lump sum benefit paid either on the death of the policyholder or at the end of a specified term, whichever occurs first. This can be seen as a hybrid of term insurance and a fixed term investment. This is no longer  offered through mainstream insurers in NA or UK as such products usually have low returns and lack of flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="others-options--riders">Others options &amp; riders</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joint life insurance: The most common format is a first- to-die policy, where the death benefit is paid on the first death of the couple, provided (for term insurance) that the death occurs within the policy term.</li>
<li>Multiple life insurance: commonly used to insure business partners.</li>
<li>Guaranteed cash values: allow to lock in guaranteed cash values by paying an additional premium.</li>
<li>Policy loans: borrow money from the insurer using the cash value as collateral. Benefits or surrender value is reduced by the amount of the outstanding loan and interest.</li>
<li>Accelerated benefits due to terminal illness</li>
<li>Accidental death benefit: higher death benefit for accidental death</li>
<li>Premium waiver on disability.</li>
<li>Family income benefit: in additional to death benefit, the insurers also pay an amount equal the annual family income × the number of years between the death and the end of the term insurance.</li>
<li>Critical illness insurance: a benefit is paid on diagnosis of one of a specified set of critical illnesses or disabilities</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="modern-insurance-contracts">Modern insurance contracts</h2>
<p>Compared with traditional policies, modern insurance is more complex, apparently more transparent in terms of costs and benefits, with flexibility in premiums and variability in benefits.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Competition with mutual funds and banks for policyholders’ savings</li>
<li>Changing demographics and lifecycles impact insurance design (e.g. jobs are more short term)</li>
<li>Developments in science and technology</li>
<li>Better informed customers</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="universal-life-insurance">Universal life insurance</h3>
<p>Very important in NA. It is generally issued as a whole life contract, but with transparent cash values, so that policyholders can view the policy as a form of savings account with built-in life insurance.</p>
<p>The insurer shares investment profits through the credited interest rate, typically monthly, which reflects the investment performance of the underlying assets. The rate is at least 0%. In some cases, there may be a guaranteed minimum rate which is greater than 0%.</p>
<h3 id="unitized-with-profit-uwp">Unitized with-profit (UWP)</h3>
<p>Popular for a time in the UK and Australia. It is similar to Universal Life insurance, except that in place of account values, policyholders’ funds are expressed in terms of units, which are shares in a notional asset portfolio. After some poor publicity surrounding with-profit business, these product designs were largely withdrawn from the UK and Australian markets in the early 2000s.</p>
<h3 id="equity-linked-insurance">Equity-linked insurance</h3>
<p>Has an endowment insurance structure, with a fixed term, and with benefits paid on the earlier of the policyholder’s death and the end of the contract term.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fund that determines the return on invested premiums is a real fund, not a notional collection of assets within the insurer’s general account.</li>
<li>Equity-linked insurance benefits may increase or decrease over time, in line with the underlying fund.</li>
<li>Premiums are invested in an open-ended, mutual fund style account.</li>
<li>Death benefit will be at least the value of the accumulated premiums, or a Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (GMDB).</li>
<li>On early surrender, policyholder will received the value of the accumulated premiums, with a surrender penalty deducted at early durations.</li>
<li>On survival to the end of the contract, the policyholder receives at least the value of the accumulated premiums, or a Guaranteed Minimum Maturity Benefit (GMMB).</li>
</ul>
<p>Unit-linked insurance is a form a equity-linked insurance whose funds are expressed in units of the underlying assets. They generally do not offer a GMMB.</p>
<p>Variable annuities, aka segregated funds, are equity-linked insurance policies sold in NA. The policies carry the option to convert the proceeds to an annuity at maturity.</p>
<h2 id="marketing-pricing-and-issuing-life-insurance">Marketing, pricing, and issuing life insurance</h2>
<h3 id="distribution">Distribution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brokers: often remunerated through a commission system.</li>
<li>Commission: a percentage of the premium paid. Usually, there is a higher percentage paid on the first premium than subsequent premiums (aka <strong>front-end load</strong>). Some advisors may be remunerated on a fixed fee basis, or may be employed by one or more insurance companies on a salary basis.</li>
<li>Face-to-face insurance sales focus on higher-wealth individuals.</li>
<li>Bank can act as intermediaries.</li>
<li>Direct marketing becomes more popular and suitable for lower-risk term insurance and pre-need insurance (which is aimed at older lives and covers funeral costs).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="underwriting">Underwriting</h3>
<p>Generally, the applicant will complete a proposal form that asks for information regarding relevant rating factors, e.g., age, gender (if permitted), smoking habits, occupation, dangerous hobbies, personal and family history, etc. The insurer may ask to contact the applicant's doctor. For very large sums insured, the insurers may required that applicant's health be checked by a doctor employed by the insurer.</p>
<p>With that, the applicant will generally be categorized into</p>
<ul>
<li>Preferred lives: low mortality risk</li>
<li>Normal lives.</li>
<li>Rated lives: have one more more risk factors at raised levels and so are not acceptable at standard premium rates.</li>
<li>Uninsurable lives: have significant risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first 3 groups may be further categorized in details. Usually, only a small portion (2%-3%) may be accepted at sub-standard rates and 2%-3% is  uninsurable.</p>
<p>The rigor of the underwriting process also depends on the type of insurance, on the sum insured, and on the distribution process.  <strong>Adverse selection</strong> (also called anti-selection) is when policyholders use information about their own individual risk profile to make choices that will benefit them. To counter this,</p>
<ul>
<li>Term insurance, especially if the sum insured is very large, is generally more strictly underwritten than whole life.</li>
<li>Direct marketed contracts usually need no medical evidence (hence low acquisition expenses), and the insurer may assume relatively heavy mortality.</li>
<li>In the event of the death of the insured life, the insurer may investigate whether any pertinent information was withheld from the application</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="premiums">Premiums</h3>
<p>Generally, premium can be</p>
<ul>
<li>level amount throughout the term (more traditional), can be annually, monthly, etc.</li>
<li>variable at policyholder's discretion or at insurer's discretion (e.g. renewable term insurance)</li>
</ul>
<p>Premiums are paid at the start of each period.</p>
<h2 id="life-annuities">Life annuities</h2>
<p>Offer a regular series of payments and depend on the survival of the recipient (aka annuitant). There is 2 major types:</p>
<ul>
<li>whole life annuity: payments continues until the death</li>
<li>term life annuity: payments until a limited period, or death (whichever is earlier)</li>
</ul>
<p>Surrender: allowed to prevent adverse selection (mostly unwell annuitant wants to terminate and receive annuity's cash value).</p>
<p>Underwriting: not needed for regular annuities as insurers face longevity risk and it is not considered feasible to seek health evidence that potential annuitants are too long-lived.</p>
<p>Annuities types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single premium deferred annuity (SPDA): pay a single premium up front and the annuity commences payment at some future. If the annuitant dies before the annuity commences, there may be death benefit due. If the annuitant dies soon after the annuity commences, there may be some minimum payment period (aka <strong>the guarantee period</strong>).</li>
<li>Single premium immediate annuity (SPIA): single premium and annuity starts immediately. Guarantee period may also be applicable.</li>
<li>Regular premium deferred annuity (RPDA): like SPDA, but the premiums are paid through the deferred period.</li>
<li>Joint life annuity: payment stops on the first death of the couple.</li>
<li>Last survivor annuity: payment stops on the second death of the couple.</li>
<li>Reversionary annuity: contingent on two lives (the insured and the annuitant). Payments only start after the insured dies and continue for the remainder of annuitant's life.</li>
<li>Guaranteed annuity: has a minimum payment period, regardless of the survival of the annuitant. If the annuitant is still alive, the annuity will continue.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-coverages-in-health-insurance">Long-term coverages in health insurance</h2>
<h3 id="disability-income-insurance">Disability income insurance</h3>
<p>Designed to replace income for individuals who cannot work due to sickness of disability. Level premiums are payable through the term of the policy, but are suspended during the period of disability. Benefits are usually related to the policyholder's salary but are capped at 50%-70% to encourage policyholder to return to work. It can continue until the insured person reaches retirement age.</p>
<p>Common features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>waiting period</strong> or <strong>elimination period</strong>: time between the beginning of disability and the beginning of benefit payment.</li>
<li>payment can be based on <strong>total disability</strong> or <strong>partial disability</strong>, the latter of which may be eligible for a lower benefit.</li>
<li>payment may be reduced if the policyholder received disability-related income from other sources.</li>
<li>benefit payment term can be limited number of years or up to the retirement age. Payment only stop if the policyholder fully recovers, the benefit term is reach, or the policyholder dies.</li>
<li>for shorter benefit payment terms (e.g. 2 years), the policy covers each separate period of disability. If sufficient time (aka <strong>off period</strong>) has elapsed between periods of disability, the benefits would be payment again up to the benefit payment terms.</li>
<li>total disability may be based on the policyholder’s inability to perform their <strong>own job</strong> or <strong>any job</strong>. The latter will require the policyholder undertake paid work that is less demanding then their own job before they receive benefit.</li>
<li>long-term disability may be increased in line with inflation.</li>
<li>usually purchased as a group insurance as group policies carry less risk from adverse selection or non-payment.</li>
<li>policies often include additional benefits such as return to work assistance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="long-term-care-insurance">Long-term care insurance</h3>
<ul>
<li>benefit triggers based on the <strong>Activities of Daily Living</strong> (ADLs), commonly 6:
<ul>
<li>bathing</li>
<li>dressing</li>
<li>eating (does not include cooking)</li>
<li>toileting</li>
<li>continence</li>
<li>transferring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>waiting period may also be applicable for ADLs triggered and benefits start.</li>
<li>often an alternative trigger based on severe cognitive impairment.</li>
<li>usually requires 2 ADLs for the benefit to trigger, some requires 3.</li>
<li>policy can have a definite term benefit (e.g. 2-5 years) or indefinite period (continues as long as the trigger conditions apply).</li>
<li>benefit payments may be reimbursement paid to the caregiving organization (up to some limit) or a fixed annuity payable.</li>
<li>payments or payment limits may increase with inflation.</li>
<li>for definite term benefit, off period may be required between 2 periods of cares.</li>
<li>hybrid LTC and life insurance policies. There are different ways to combine the benefits
<ul>
<li>return of premium: if the benefit paid under the LTC insurance are less than total premium, the balance is returned as part of the death benefit.</li>
<li>accelerated benefit: the death benefit is used to pay LTC benefits.</li>
<li>extension of benefits: provide continuation of LTC benefits for a pre-determined period after the original sum insured has been exhausted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>premiums are designed to be level, but insurers may retain the right to increase premiums for all policyholders if the experience is sufficiently adverse (required approval from the regulating body).</li>
</ul>
<p>LTC in the world</p>
<ul>
<li>France: very popular and are simpler (usually fixed or inflation-indexed annuity) and cheaper. They have lower premiums due to lower average benefits, more stringent payment requirement, often purchased through group plans by employers, and usually purchased at younger ages.</li>
<li>Germany: basic LTC costs are covered under the government-provided social health insurance. Individual can top up with private insurance or opt out and use private insurance entirely. Benefits are fixed annuities.</li>
<li>Japan: LTC is stand-alone or as a rider on life policy. Benefit increases as the level of dependency increases.</li>
<li>UK: no regular premium LTC as it is not popular. It has immediate needs annuity, which is purchased as the individual is about to move permanently into residential long-term care. The benefit is paid as a regular fixed annuity, but is paid directly to the care home. Because the covered lives are assumed to be somewhat impaired, it has lower longevity risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="critical-illness-insurance">Critical illness insurance</h3>
<p>Pays a lump sum on diagnosis of one of a list of specific diseases and conditions, which usually include include heart attack, stroke, major organ failure and most forms of cancer. Once the claim arises, the benefit is paid and the policy expires. Some policies offer a partial return of premium if the policy expires or lapses without a critical illness diagnosis.</p>
<p>Policies usually have level premiums and may cease at some age.</p>
<p>It may be added to a life insurance policy as an accelerated benefit rider.</p>
<h3 id="chronic-illness-insurance">Chronic illness insurance</h3>
<p>Chronic illness insurance pays a benefit on diagnosis of a chronic illness, one that will not recover but not necessarily terminal. Benefit payment can be a lump sum or an annuity. It is typically added to a standard life insurance as an accelerated benefit rider.</p>
<h2 id="mutual-and-proprietary-insurers">Mutual and proprietary insurers</h2>
<p>A <strong>mutual</strong> insurance company is one that has no shareholders. The insurer is owned by the with-profit policyholders. All profits are distributed to the with- profit policyholders through dividends or bonuses.</p>
<p>A <strong>proprietary</strong> insurance company has shareholders, and usually has with-profit policyholders as well. In a proprietary insurer, the profits must be shared in some predetermined proportion between the shareholders and the with-profit policyholders.</p>
<p>Many early life insurance companies were formed as mutual companies. Recently, in UK &amp; NA, there has been a trend towards demutualization (moving from mutual to proprietary), with advantages such as increasing ability to raise capital, clearer corporate structure, and improve efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="other-life-contingent-contracts">Other life contingent contracts</h2>
<h3 id="continuing-care-retirement-communities-ccrcs">Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs)</h3>
<p>These are residential facilities for seniors. Many offer funding packages where the costs of future care are covered by combination of an entry fee and a monthly charge.</p>
<p>Funding options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full life care contract: pay a large upfront fee, and monthly payments (level or increasing with cost of living) and resident is guaranteed that all residential, personal assistance and health care needs will be covered without further cost.</li>
<li>Modified life care contract: pay lower monthly fees, and possibly a lower entry fee, but will have to pay additional costs for some services if they need them.</li>
<li>Fee-for-service: contracts involve little or no pre-funding of health care. Residents pay for the health care they receive at the current market rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full life care or modified life care contracts are for sufficiently well residents. Disabled residents may only be eligible for fee-for-service contract.</li>
<li>Entry fee may be partially refunded upon the resident's death or moving out.</li>
<li>Some CCRSs offer ownership of the living units. In the case the resident dies or moves out, the unit is sold and the proceeds are shared between the resident (or her estate) and the CCRC.</li>
<li>It is common for couples to purchase CCRC.</li>
<li>The full life care and modified life care contracts transfer the risk of increasing health care costs from the resident to the CCRC, and thus are a form of insurance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="structured-settlements">Structured settlements</h3>
<p>A structured settlement is the payment schedule agreed between the <strong>injured party (IP)</strong> and the <strong>responsible party (RP)</strong>, usually through their lawyers, or through an insurer when the RP’s liability is covered by an insurance policy. It is often used for payments under workers' compensation insurance, medical malpractice cases, or other personal injury claims.</p>
<p>In cases of potentially severe injury, there is often a period of uncertainty as to the extent of damage and long-term prognosis for the IP. Hence, there may be an interim arrange of benefit until the time of maximum medical improvement, at which point the final structured settlement will be determined.</p>
<p>Lump sum vs. annuity: annuity relieves the IP from investment risk and from dissipation risk, which is the risk of overspending. To determine the annuity payment, there are</p>
<ul>
<li>top-down approach: converting an appropriate lump sum into an annuity,</li>
<li>bottom-up approach: starting wit ha suitable income stream, and then converts that to a capital value (more appropriate).</li>
</ul>
<p>In some areas of the US, the IP may transfer their annuity to a specialist firm in exchange for a lum sum (aka <strong>structured settlement buy-out</strong>). These firms were making excessive profits, so this buy-outs are prohibited in many area or at least required court approval. This is not allowed in Canada.</p>
<h2 id="pensions">Pensions</h2>
<h3 id="defined-benefit-db-pensions">Defined benefit (DB) pensions</h3>
<p>Provide members with lifetime retirement income, with the amount of annual pension determined using a formula that depends on the member’s salary and period of service.</p>
